Critical Errors (Currently Active): 1. Three.js Shader Error Location: client/src/components/three/ThreeBackground.tsx Issue: Shader compilation error - 'color' : redefinition at line 71 Impact: 3D background effects are broken, causing console spam Status: Active error showing in browser console 2. Authentication System Issues Route Mismatch: Frontend calls /api/auth/user but backend only has /api/user Missing Implementation: replitAuth.ts is missing (only backup exists) Impact: Users cannot authenticate, blocking access to protected features Status: Partially working but inconsistent 3. Missing Dependencies Authentication: Missing passport-related packages for full auth implementation Impact: Authentication system is incomplete High Priority Issues: 4. Database/Data Issues Status: APIs return data but authentication blocks full functionality Console Shows: GET /api/campaigns 304 - Returns campaigns data GET /api/contributions 304 - Returns contributions GET /api/stats 304 - Shows totalRaised: "6000.0", activeCampaigns: "3" Issue: Data exists but user access is limited due to auth problems 5. Environment Variables Missing OpenAI API Key: Required for AI campaign features Session Secrets: May be missing for proper authentication Impact: Some features may not work fully Medium Priority Issues: 6. CORS Configuration Issue: Missing CORS headers mentioned in analysis Impact: Potential API call failures in production 7. UI/UX Authentication Warnings Location: AccessGuide.tsx shows "Authentication Error" badge Message: "OpenID Connect authorization response error. Working on fix." Impact: User confusion about authentication status Current Status Assessment: Good News: Server is running successfully on port 5000 Database connection is working Data seeding is complete API endpoints are responding with actual data Most features are implemented and ready Main Blocker: Authentication system inconsistency is the primary issue preventing full functionality Three.js shader error is causing visual problems Resolution Priority: Fix Three.js shader error (immediate visual fix) Resolve authentication route mismatch Complete authentication implementation Configure missing environment variables Test all protected routes after auth is fixed The website is actually quite functional based on the console logs showing successful API calls and data retrieval - the main issues are authentication consistency and the shader error.
