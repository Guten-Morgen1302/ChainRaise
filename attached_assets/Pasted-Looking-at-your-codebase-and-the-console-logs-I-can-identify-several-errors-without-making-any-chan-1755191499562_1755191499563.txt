Looking at your codebase and the console logs, I can identify several errors without making any changes:

Current Errors Found:
1. Three.js Shader Error (Active)
THREE.WebGLProgram: Shader Error 0 - VALIDATE_STATUS false
ERROR: 0:71: 'color' : redefinition
Location: client/src/components/three/ThreeBackground.tsx
Issue: The vertex shader is trying to redeclare the color attribute which already exists in Three.js built-in attributes
Impact: 3D background effects are broken
2. Authentication System Issues
From the attached analysis document and console logs:

Missing Route: The console shows GET /api/auth/user calls, but in server/routes.ts the route is defined as /api/auth/user while server/auth.ts defines /api/user
Route Mismatch: Frontend is calling /api/auth/user but backend only has /api/user
Impact: Authentication state checking fails
3. Database/Data Issues
From console logs:

GET /api/campaigns 200 in 509ms :: []
GET /api/contributions 200 in 476ms :: []
GET /api/stats 200 in 592ms :: {"totalRaised":"0.0","activeCampaigns":"0"...
Issue: All data queries return empty results
Possible Causes: No seed data, database connection issues, or data creation blocked by auth
4. Missing Dependencies
From the analysis document:

Missing passport-related packages for authentication
Potential missing OpenAI API key configuration
5. CORS Issues
The analysis mentions missing CORS headers which could cause API call failures.

6. Potential Database Schema Issues
The analysis mentions problems with user upsert method in the database layer.

7. Environment Variables
Missing configuration for:

OpenAI API key (for AI features)
Session secrets
Other service integrations
Error Priority:
Critical: Three.js shader error (currently breaking UI)
Critical: Authentication route mismatch
High: Empty database/no seed data
Medium: Missing environment variables
Low: CORS configuration
The most immediate visible error is the Three.js shader issue causing console spam, followed by the authentication system problems preventing full application functionality.
