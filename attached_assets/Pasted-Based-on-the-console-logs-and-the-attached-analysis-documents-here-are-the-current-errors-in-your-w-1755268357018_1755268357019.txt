Based on the console logs and the attached analysis documents, here are the current errors in your website: Current Active Errors: 1. Database Connection Error (Critical) The workflow is failing with a PostgreSQL connection error. The console shows the application is trying to connect to the Neon database but the connection is being terminated: Connection to ep-gentle-haze-a2r1zhab.eu-central-1.aws.neon.tech is failing This is preventing the server from starting properly 2. Vite Hot Module Replacement Issues From the webview logs: [vite] server connection lost. Polling for restart... Multiple reconnection attempts are happening This indicates the development server is unstable 3. Authentication System Issues (From Previous Analysis) Route mismatch: Frontend calls /api/auth/user but backend has /api/user Missing or incomplete replitAuth.ts implementation Users getting 401 Unauthorized errors 4. Three.js Shader Error (From Previous Analysis) Shader compilation error with 'color' : redefinition Located in client/src/components/three/ThreeBackground.tsx Causing console spam and broken 3D background effects 5. Workflow Failure The "Start application" workflow is in a failed state npm run dev command is not completing successfully due to the database connection issue Error Priority: Critical: Database connection preventing server startup Critical: Three.js shader error breaking UI High: Authentication route inconsistency Medium: Vite development server instability Root Cause: The main blocker appears to be the PostgreSQL database connection issue, which is preventing the Express server from starting properly. This cascades into other issues as the backend API is not available. The database connection error suggests either: Database credentials/URL are incorrect Network connectivity issues to Neon Database instance is not accessible or has been paused Once the database connection is resolved, the server should start properly and most of the authentication and API issues should be resolved.
