Main Issues Found: 1. Authentication System Broken (Critical) Console shows repeated GET /api/auth/user 401 in 2ms :: {"message":"Unauthorized"} errors Users cannot log in, which blocks access to most features The authentication middleware in server/routes.ts is rejecting all requests 2. Missing Authentication Implementation Looking at the auth setup in server/routes.ts, the setupAuth and isAuthenticated functions are imported from ./replitAuth but the actual implementation seems incomplete or broken. 3. Database Connection Issues All API responses show empty data ([] for campaigns, transactions) Stats show "totalRaised":"0.0","activeCampaigns":"0","tot..." This suggests either no data exists or database queries are failing 4. Route Protection Blocking Access Most pages require authentication but auth is broken Users get stuck on landing page unable to access main features Profile setup, KYC, dashboard, campaigns all inaccessible 5. Incomplete Feature Implementation From the code, several features are partially implemented: KYC verification system exists but can't be accessed AI campaign analysis features exist but require login Blockchain transaction tracking exists but shows no data 6. UI/UX Issues Users see "authentication system is currently experiencing issues" warnings No clear path to access features without working auth Database appears empty (likely due to auth blocking data creation) 7. Missing Environment Variables The OpenAI integration and other services likely need environment variables that may not be configured. Recommended Fix Priority: Fix authentication system first - this will unlock access to all other features Verify database connection and seeding Test protected routes after auth is working Configure missing environment variables The core issue is the broken authentication system preventing users from accessing the fully-built application features. Once auth is fixed, users should be able to create accounts, complete KYC, create campaigns, and use all the AI-powered features that are already implemented. also other Summary of All Issues: Authentication system broken (missing replitAuth.ts implementation) Missing auth dependencies (passport packages) Database connection working but no data (due to auth blocking) Missing environment variables (need Secrets configuration) Potential database schema issues (user upsert method) CORS headers missing (for API calls)
