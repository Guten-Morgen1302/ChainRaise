Build me a full-stack, multi-page Web3 crowdfunding platform — think Kickstarter meets GoFundMe meets AngelList — but with next-level, jaw-dropping cyberpunk x glassmorphism UI and real blockchain fund tracking for global use.

Core Concept
A global, trust-first crowdfunding dApp where:

Creators launch campaigns after on-chain verified KYC.

Backers fund using crypto (Polygon testnet) or fiat (mock Razorpay/Stripe).

Every contribution is transparently recorded on-chain with a public explorer view.

UI is so stunning that it feels like a high-budget sci-fi fintech dashboard.

Roles & Flows
Creator

Must pass KYC (upload docs → AI-assisted OCR verification → admin approval).

Can create campaigns with:

Funding model: Donation / Reward / Equity Simulation

Goal amount & deadline

Rich campaign story with videos/images

Category & tags

Manage dashboard: track pledges, withdraw funds, update backers.

Backer

Browse campaigns by category, funding type, or trending.

Contribute in crypto or fiat.

See real-time progress bar, backer list, and live transaction feed.

Blockchain Magic
Polygon Mumbai testnet smart contract to store:

Campaign metadata

Contributions

Equity simulation data

Ethers.js integration in frontend.

Every transaction linked to Polygonscan.

Funding Transparency Page: Filterable ledger of all contributions.

UI/UX Direction
Cyberpunk neon meets minimal glassmorphism.

Animated gradients, particle backgrounds, liquid hover effects.

Real-time animated charts & progress bars.

Campaign cards with hover parallax + glow borders.

Framer Motion page transitions.

Mobile-first with buttery-smooth swipes & gestures.

Multi-page layout:

Landing Page (hero + trending campaigns carousel + search)

Campaign List

Campaign Detail Page (interactive tabs: Story / Updates / Backers / On-Chain Ledger)

KYC Page

Creator Dashboard

Backer Dashboard

Global Transaction Feed

About/How It Works

AI Campaign Assistant (improves description, estimates funding probability)

Bonus Features for the “W”
AI-driven campaign credibility score (based on KYC + social proof + funding velocity).

Live whale donor tracking — highlight big contributions instantly.

Gamified backer profiles with badges, ranks, and streaks.

Instant shareable “campaign QR codes” for IRL fundraising events.

Night/day mode toggle with animated theme morph.

Tech Stack
Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI + Framer Motion + Three.js (for subtle 3D effects)

Backend: Next.js API Routes (Node.js) + Supabase (auth, storage, campaigns, KYC)

Blockchain: Solidity smart contract on Polygon Mumbai + Ethers.js frontend integration

Payments: Crypto (Polygon) + Fiat mock (Razorpay/Stripe test mode)

AI: OpenAI API for description enhancement + credibility scoring

Storage: Supabase for images/docs, IPFS for decentralized campaign assets

Key Judge Impress Points
Live, interactive blockchain explorer inside the site (not just links out).

Ultra-polished animated micro-interactions for every button and scroll.

AI built-in → feels like a smart assistant, not just a static site.

International-ready with multi-language support toggle.
