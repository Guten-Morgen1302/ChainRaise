Admin Portal Real-Time Requirements:

Total Users Counter & User Management Table:

When a user creates an account, instantly update the counter and add them to the User Management table with columns: User, Email, KYC Status, Status, Joined, and Actions.

Admin can delete account, flag/unflag user, approve/reject KYC directly from the Actions column.

All actions must instantly reflect across all connected admin sessions without refresh.

Total Campaigns Counter:

When a user creates a campaign, instantly update the counter and display it in the campaigns list.

Admin can approve/reject campaigns from the dashboard with immediate real-time updates.

Pending KYC:

When a user completes KYC, instantly show them in the Pending KYC list until reviewed.

Upon approval/rejection, remove from pending list and update counts in real time.

Flagged Users:

When an admin flags a user, update the counter instantly and add them to the flagged users list.

When unflagged, remove instantly from the list and update count.

Real-Time Updates:

Use WebSockets, Socket.io, or server-sent events so any change in database reflects instantly across all active admin sessions.

Admin Actions:

Admin should be able to:

Approve/Reject KYC

Flag/Unflag User

Delete User Account

Approve/Reject Campaigns

All changes must be written to the database instantly and broadcast in real time to other connected clients.

Backend Integration:

Fix database queries so they correctly fetch the latest data from PostgreSQL.

Ensure database triggers or event emitters broadcast changes immediately.

Resolve PostgreSQL connection issues so backend starts reliably.

Ensure correct API routes exist for all admin actions and return updated data after every change.

Frontend Integration:

Dashboard counters, tables, and lists should auto-update without refresh.

Implement state management (e.g., Redux, Zustand, React Query) to keep UI in sync.

Add loading indicators for actions and error toasts for failed updates.

Ensure the admin is always authenticated before performing dashboard actions.
