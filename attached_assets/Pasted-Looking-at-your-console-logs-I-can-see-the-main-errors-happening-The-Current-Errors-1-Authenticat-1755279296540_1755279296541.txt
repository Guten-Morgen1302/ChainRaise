Looking at your console logs, I can see the main errors happening: The Current Errors 1. Authentication Issues: /api/transactions/avalanche returns 401 Authentication required /api/user/campaigns returns 401 Authentication required /api/notifications returns 401 Authentication required 2. Unhandled Promise Rejections: These are likely from the failed API calls above How the Payment System Actually Works Here's how to make payments in your platform: Step 1: Get Authenticated Go to /auth page Login with existing account or register new one Complete your profile (add name, email, etc.) Step 2: Complete KYC (Required for Creating Campaigns) Go to /kyc page after logging in Fill out KYC form with personal details Wait for admin approval Only KYC-approved users can create campaigns Step 3: Making a Payment (Contributing to Campaigns) Browse campaigns on the home page or /campaigns Click on any campaign card to view details Click "Support This Campaign" button Choose payment method: Crypto Tab: Connect wallet (MetaMask), select token (ETH/MATIC/USDC), enter amount Fiat Tab: Currently shows "Coming Soon" - it's in demo mode Step 4: Crypto Payment Flow Click "Connect Wallet" (currently uses mock wallet) Select token type (ETH, MATIC, or USDC) Enter contribution amount Click "Continue" â†’ "Confirm & Pay" Transaction gets processed and recorded Why It's Not Working Fully The Real Issues: Authentication: You need to be logged in to access most features Mock Payments: The crypto payments are currently simulated (not real blockchain transactions) Fiat Payments: Credit card payments are disabled/demo mode API Errors: Some endpoints require authentication but your session might be expired Quick Fix to Test Payments Login First: Go to /auth and create an account Try a Campaign: Go back to home page, click any campaign Test Crypto Payment: Use the crypto payment tab (it's mock but functional) Check Dashboard: After payment, check your dashboard to see contributions The system is designed to work, but you need to be authenticated to use most features. The 401 errors you're seeing are because the live-transactions page is trying to access admin-only endpoints without proper authentication.
